# Micro Grad
- this is a guild to create simple Neuron Network by following Andrej Karpathy's series: [Neural Networks:Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&index=2&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy):

# About the project

## Goals:
- To clearly understand how Gradient Descent and Backpropagation work under the hood:


## Structure:
- The Value class is the core of this project, which includes Mathematical Operations
- THe MLP class is to help to build multi-layer Perceptron
